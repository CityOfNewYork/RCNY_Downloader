# RCNY downloader by Andrew Nicklin (@technickle)
#
# Downloads the Rules of the City of New York (RCNY) to a local folder; converts to XML
#   Overwrites files if they already exist.
#   Each rule is placed into a separate XML file.
#   Errors while not handling section content are always fatal.
#   <section_content> tag holds HTML fragment as XML CDATA.
#
# KNOWN ISSUES
#   does not handle images referenced within pages (which do exist)
#   first and last pages will have truncated <section_content>
# 
# usage: ruby rcny_download.rb [titlenode.txt URL] [local_path]
#
# How it works:
#   download the rcny master tree (titlenodes.txt) file
# 	for each item in file
#		note the title and agency
#		parse the referenced frame html files (Title1eftframe.htm) 
#		parse the nodedata parameter file (<param name="Nodedata" value="title1_tree.txt">)
#       download the notedata (title1_tree.txt)
#		for each item in the file (ignoring irrelevant lines)
#			note the chapter and subchapter
#			note the section number and section title
#			identify and download the referenced content file
#			extract the section content from HTML (clip top & bottom lines by count)
#			save everything to an XML file
#		loop
